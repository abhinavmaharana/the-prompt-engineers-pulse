# 🚀 Complete Deployment Steps for City Pulse
## Deploy Your Smart City Platform to Firebase

---

## 📋 **Deployment Overview**

**You will deploy from the FRONTEND directory only** because:
- ✅ Your React app is in `frontend/`
- ✅ Firebase config is in `frontend/`
- ✅ All build files are in `frontend/`
- ✅ The backend is Firebase (Firestore + Storage)

---

## 🛠️ **Step-by-Step Deployment Process**

### **Step 1: Install Firebase CLI**
```bash
# Install Firebase CLI globally
npm install -g firebase-tools

# Verify installation
firebase --version
```

### **Step 2: Login to Firebase**
```bash
# Login to your Firebase account
firebase login

# This will open a browser window
# Use the same Google account that owns your Firebase project
```

### **Step 3: Navigate to Frontend Directory**
```bash
# Make sure you're in the frontend directory
cd frontend

# Verify you're in the right place
pwd
# Should show: /Users/abhinavmaharana/Desktop/Hackathon/pulse-ai/frontend
```

### **Step 4: Install Dependencies**
```bash
# Install all required packages
npm install

# This will install React, Firebase, Google Maps, etc.
```

### **Step 5: Set Up Environment Variables**
```bash
# Create .env file for your API keys
touch .env

# Add your Google Maps API key to .env file
echo "VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_google_maps_api_key_here" > .env
```

**Important**: Replace `your_google_maps_api_key_here` with your actual Google Maps API key.

### **Step 6: Build the Application**
```bash
# Build the React app for production
npm run build

# This creates a 'dist' folder with your built application
# You should see: "✓ built in X.XXs"
```

### **Step 7: Deploy to Firebase**
```bash
# Deploy everything (hosting, firestore, storage)
firebase deploy

# Or use the npm script
npm run deploy
```
